// Diagnostic events are the protocol's own account of what a contract call
// did. Where a contract event is the contract speaking to the outside world,
// a diagnostic event is the host narrating the call: the frame it opened

// what went wrong. They are also the only place the events of a *failed* call
// survive, which is why they are worth asserting on even in a passing suite.

// Two properties of a stream are worth checking, and they are checked
// separately here:
//
//   - the order of the events, which is the call's own sequence — a stream
//     with the same events in a different order describes a different program;
//   - the ledger and close time the stream belongs to, which is the only time
//     coordinate the protocol gives a diagnostic event.
//
// Both assertions read nothing but the XDR they are handed. No clock is read
// and no network is touched, so the same meta gives the same answer every run.

// Kinds a diagnostic event is classified into.
//
// The protocol's own diagnostic events carry their kind as the first topic
// symbol, so `fn_call`, `log` and the rest are reported verbatim; everything

//
