// Package require mirrors the golden assertions with Fatalf semantics.
//
// golden.Golden.Assert reports a failure and lets the test continue, which
// is what you want in a table test that should report every problem in one
// run. This package stops the test at the first failure, which is what you
// want when everything after the comparison would be meaningless — a
// fixture that does not exist, a decode that failed, a transaction that was
// never built.
//
// The split, and the naming, follow the convention Go developers already
// know from testify's assert and require packages, and from the sibling
// package pkg/focus/require.
